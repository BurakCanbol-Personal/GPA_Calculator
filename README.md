# GPA_Calculator

It allows you to write you course names and their credit and your grade. Then you can see you gpa and if you want you can save all data you entered which prevent you to write all courses and grades again and again next time you want to calculate your GPA. The code also has a feature called "estimateNeededGPA()" where you can figure out what average GPA score you need according to the remaining courses' credits.



You need to write this line to create gpa_tracker
g++ -o gpa_tracker gpa_tracker.cpp
then to run it:
./gpa_tracker
